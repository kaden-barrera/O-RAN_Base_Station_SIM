# Set the working directory inside the container

# Copy the necessary files into the container

COPY du.h .
COPY du_bindings.cpp .
COPY CMakeLists.txt .

# Install required dependencies (if any)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \

# Build the microservice
RUN cmake .
RUN make

# Expose any ports needed for communication (if applicable)
# EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the microservice when the container starts
CMD ["./your_executable"]

#### FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION ####

# Replace ''./your_executable' with the actual command needed to start your Distributed Unit microservice.
# This could be the name of the executable generated by the make command or any other command needed
# to launch your microservice.

# Make sure to adjust the COPY commands to copy the necessary source code files (du.cpp, du.h,
# du_bindings.cpp, CMakeLists.txt) into the Docker container. Additionally, update the 'apt-get
# install' command to install any required dependencies for building and running your microservice.

# Once you have created your Dockerfile, you can build a Docker image using the following command:
#(bash) docker build -t distributed-unit-image .

# Replace 'distributed-unit-image' with the desired name for your Docker image. After building the image, you
# can run a Docker container using the following command:
#(bash) docker run -d --name distributed-unit-container distributed-unit-image

# This will start a container named distributed-unit-container based on the Docker image you built. Adjust
# the container name and image name as needed for your specific project requirements.

# Ensure that your Dockerfile and source code files are structured appropriately for building and running your
# Distributed Unit microservice within a Docker container. Test the Docker image and container to verify that
# your microservice functions correctly in the containerized environment.
